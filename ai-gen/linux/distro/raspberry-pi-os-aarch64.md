# Raspberry Pi OS & AArch64 (64-bit) Support

* Traditionally, Raspberry Pi OS was **32-bit only**, even on 64-bit capable Pi models.
* However, since **May 2020**, the Raspberry Pi Foundation released an **official 64-bit version** of Raspberry Pi OS.
* This 64-bit version is based on **Debian Bullseye** and supports **AArch64** (ARM64) architecture.
* It runs natively on **Raspberry Pi 3, 4, and newer models** with 64-bit CPUs.
