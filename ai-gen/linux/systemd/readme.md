# üß≠ systemd: High-Level Overview

---

## üîç What is `systemd`?

* `systemd` is a **system and service manager** for Linux.
* It is used to **bootstrap** the system (initialize userspace) and **manage services** during runtime.
* Developed to replace the older `SysVinit` and `Upstart` systems.
* It's now the **default init system** for most major Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, RHEL, Arch, etc.).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Responsibilities

| Function                  | Description                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Init system**           | PID 1 ‚Äî starts at boot and initializes the system       |
| **Service manager**       | Starts, stops, restarts, enables, and monitors services |
| **Parallel startup**      | Boots services in parallel for faster boot times        |
| **Dependency management** | Understands and respects service dependencies           |
| **Logging**               | Integrates with `journald` for centralized logs         |
| **Socket activation**     | Starts daemons only when their socket is used           |
| **Timers**                | Replaces traditional `cron` for scheduled tasks         |
| **Mounting**              | Automates mount points via `.mount` units               |
| **Network management**    | Manages network settings via `networkd` (optional)      |
| **User sessions**         | Handles login sessions and user services                |

## üß± Key Components

| Component     | Role                               |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `systemd`     | Core daemon (PID 1)                |
| `systemctl`   | CLI tool to manage systemd units   |
| `journalctl`  | View logs collected by `journald`  |
| `loginctl`    | Manage user logins and sessions    |
| `timedatectl` | Set system clock and timezone      |
| `hostnamectl` | Manage hostname info               |
| `localectl`   | Configure system locale and keymap |

## üß© Unit Files

* **Unit files** are configuration files that describe services and other managed entities.
* They typically live in `/etc/systemd/system/` or `/lib/systemd/system/`.

### Common Unit Types:

| Type      | Extension  | Purpose                         |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| `service` | `.service` | System daemons and apps         |
| `socket`  | `.socket`  | Socket activation               |
| `timer`   | `.timer`   | Scheduled tasks (like cron)     |
| `mount`   | `.mount`   | Mount points                    |
| `target`  | `.target`  | Group of units (like runlevels) |
| `device`  | `.device`  | Hardware devices                |

## üß™ Basic Commands

```bash
# Start a service
sudo systemctl start nginx

# Enable service at boot
sudo systemctl enable nginx

# View status
systemctl status nginx

# List running services
systemctl list-units --type=service

# View logs
journalctl -u nginx
```

## üß† Why systemd?

### ‚úÖ Pros:

* Fast parallel boot
* Robust service supervision
* Centralized configuration and logging
* Modular and extensible
* Unified toolset across distributions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons:

* Monolithic design (includes many components)
* Can feel complex or opaque for newcomers
* Some Unix purists prefer more minimal init systems
